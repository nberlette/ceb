The goal of this example is to create a simple widget to create new lines and remove existing ones.

For performance purpose, the templating is handled by [incremental-dom].
Its integration is done by another library, [idomizer].
This example is based on the builder [idomify](../builders/idomify.md).

The live example is alive [there](live-list-plusplus).
