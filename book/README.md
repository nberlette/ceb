# &lt;ceb/&gt; ~ Custom Element Builder

`<ceb/>` was initially a library dedicated for the authoring of [Custom Elements (v0)] then [Custom Elements (v1)].
However, the library is now providing building blocks going beyond the topic of composable UI elements.
It's about fundamental design principles, messaging, functional rendering and obviously composition of UI elements ;).

`<ceb/>` is released under the [MIT license].

The source code is available on GitHub: [github.com/tmorin/ceb].
