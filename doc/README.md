# `<ceb/>` custom-element-builder

`<ceb/>` is a library helping to develop [Custom Elements](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom).

Its core is a builder which executes others builders.
By this way, `<ceb/>` is natively opened to extensions and builders easily sharable. 

Obviously, `<ceb/>` exposes builders and helpers handling the common needs:

- property
- attribute
- events
- delegation to child element (attribute, property and method)
- templating
- event dispatching
- type checking
- etc.
